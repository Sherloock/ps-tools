# PowerShell Toolkit Standards

## Rule Usage

When applying any rule from `.cursor/rules/`, always reference which rule you're following (e.g., "Per `timer.mdc`: ...").

## Code Standards

- PowerShell 5.1 compatible (no ternary operators `? :`)
- Handle long Windows paths using `-LiteralPath`
- Format sizes in GB/MB using SI units

## User Feedback (MANDATORY)

- ALWAYS show progress/status during operations
- Colors: Green=success, Yellow=warning, Red=error, Cyan=info
- Display operation summaries (items processed, time elapsed, results count)
- Never run silent operations

## Documentation (MANDATORY)

- ALWAYS update `README.md` when adding/modifying/removing functions
- Document under appropriate section (Core/Dev/Media)
- Keep descriptions concise (one line, action-oriented)
- Update folder structure in README when creating new files/folders

## Folder Structure

- `core/`: System utilities, timers, dashboard components
- `dev/`: Development tools, port management, navigation
- `media/`: File/video library management
