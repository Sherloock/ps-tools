# Dashboard & Help System

## The `??` Function

The `??` function is the main dashboard that lists all user-facing functions in the toolkit with their descriptions.

### How it works

1. Scans all `.ps1` files recursively in the toolkit directory
2. Finds function definitions and extracts their `.SYNOPSIS` help block
3. Displays function name, parameters, and description in a formatted table

### Exclusion Mechanisms

Functions and files can be excluded from `??` listing:

**Excluded by function name** (`$ExcludedFunctions`):

- `??` - the dashboard itself
- `Write-SizeTable`, `Get-SizeColor` - internal display helpers

**Excluded by file** (`$ExcludedFiles`):

- `Helpers.ps1` - contains internal utilities only
- `Timer.ps1` - has its own help via `timer` command

### SYNOPSIS Requirement

Every user-facing function MUST include a `<# .SYNOPSIS #>` block:

```powershell
function MyFunction {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Brief one-line description shown in ?? dashboard.
    #>
    # function body
}
```

Without this, the function shows "No description provided."

## Helper Functions

- Internal/helper functions go in `core/Helpers.ps1`, NOT in feature files
- `Helpers.ps1` is loaded first by `loader.ps1` and excluded from `??` dashboard
- Feature files should only contain user-facing functions

## Module Help Functions

Each feature module with multiple commands should have a help function:

- Type `timer` (without args) → shows timer commands help
- Type `??` → shows main dashboard

This keeps `??` clean while providing detailed help for complex modules.
